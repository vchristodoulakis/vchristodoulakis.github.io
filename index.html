		<h1 style="width: 700px!important;">The reasons and the science behind car accidents</h1>
		<hr>
		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			In 2022 the number one cause of death for the young people are still the car accidents. Using visualization
			analysis, this project aims to shed light to the real causes behind it. This will be done via a science
			backed model in order to have a better chance in solving this problem while also providing to everyone a
			clear visual analysis of the reasons and their correlations.
		</p>
		<h3>Details</h3>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			This project tries to explore, using two different datasets, the reasons and causes of all these accidents,
			while also trying to find a trend of the casualties and accidents in combination with all the different
			parameters affecting those.
		</p>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			The first dataset shows the distribution of fatal accidents all over Europe. We observe that European
			countries fatal accidents number is an inverse proportion to their GDP <a
				href="credits.html#source_1">[1]</a>,with few exceptions like Russia, in which other factors come to
			play such as alcohol consumption <a href="credits.html#source_2">[2]</a>, violent
			crimes rate <a href="credits.html#source_3">[3]</a>, etc.
		</p>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			In order to further investigate this issue, the second dataset is specialized in traffic accidents in the
			UK. This country was selected on purpose due to the high economic development <a
				href="credits.html#source_1">[1]</a>(in correlation with the previous observation), the volume of road
			accessibility, quality and usage <a href="credits.html#source_4">[4]</a> and finally due to the high number
			of data available.
		</p>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			The UK dataset dashboard has the following graphs:
		<ul>
			<li>Accidents Per Year Quarter</li>
			<li>Accidents Per Sex</li>
			<li>Accidents Per Day of Week</li>
			<li>Casualties Per Age</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			From the analysis of the above graphs and visualizations, we can make the following inferences:
		<ul>
			<li>During the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a drop in the rate of accidents. This drop is
				observed from the 2020 Q1, reaching the lowest point during the 2020 Q2. Obviously, this occurred due to
				the quarantine that was implemented in the UK starting on April in which the low volume of car
				circulation lowered by a lot the chances of traffic accidents happening.</li>
			<li>Men are more potent to traffic accidents, due to the fact that they are reported to commit violent acts
				significantly more frequently than women <a href="credits.html#source_5">[5]</a>. Also, this supports
				studies that women have a safer road
				behavior than men do <a href="credits.html#source_6">[6]</a>.</li>
			<li>Friday and Saturday are the weekdays with the highest volume of traffic accidents. As we can assume,
				those two days are the days when most people have plans for their entertainment, usually involving
				alcohol consumption. Thus, these days have the most risk of fatal accidents, as supported already by
				other studies <a href="credits.html#source_7">[7]</a>.</li>
			<li>Finally, the most careless ages are found to be between 18-30. As we can assume, during those ages a lot
				of people go out more often, due to having less responsibilities and often due to the immaturity of the
				drivers and lack of experience. This is also supported by studies that support this conclusion <a
					href="credits.html#source_8">[8]</a>.</li>
