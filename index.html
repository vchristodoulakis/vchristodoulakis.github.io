		<h1 style="width: 700px!important;">The reasons and the science behind car accidents</h1>
		<hr>
		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			In 2022 the number one cause of death for the young people are still the car accidents. Using visualization
			analysis, the project aims to shed light to the real causes behind it. This will be done via a science
			backed model in order to have a better chance in solving this problem while also providing to everyone a
			clear visual analysis of the reasons and their correlations.
		</p>
		<h3>Details</h3>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			This project tries to explore using two different datasets, to figure out reasons and causes of the many
			accidents happening, while also trying to find a trend of the casualties. and different parameters affecting
			those accidents.
		</p>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			The first dataset shows the distribution of fatal accident all over Europe. We observe that European
			countries fatal accidents number is inverse proportion to their GDP <a href="credits.html#source_1">[1]</a>, with few exceptions like Russia, in
			which other factors come to play like alcohol consumption <a href="credits.html#source_2">[2]</a>, violent crimes rate <a href="credits.html#source_3">[3]</a>, etc.
		</p>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			To further investigate this issue, the second dataset concerns traffic accidents in the UK. This country was
			selected due to the economic development the country has <a href="credits.html#source_1">[1]</a>, the volume of road accessibility, quality and
			usage [4] and finally due to the high number of data available.
		</p>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			The UK dataset dashboard has the following graphs:
		<ul>
			<li>Accidents Per Year Quarter</li>
			<li>Accidents Per Sex</li>
			<li>Accidents Per Day of Week</li>
			<li>Casualties Per Age</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p style="width: 700px!important;">
			From the analysis done using these graphs, we can make the following inferences:
		<ul>
			<li>During the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a drop to the rate of accidents. This drop is
				observed for the 2020 Q1, reaching the lowest point during the 2020 Q2. Obviously, due to the quarantine
				implemented in the UK starting April, the low volume of car circulation prevented traffic accidents from
				happening.</li>
			<li>Men are more potent to traffic accidents, due to the fact that they are reported to commit violent acts
				significantly more frequently than women <a href="credits.html#source_5">[5]</a>. Also, this supports studies that women have a safer road
				behavior than men do <a href="credits.html#source_6">[6]</a>.</li>
			<li>Friday and Saturday are the weekdays with the highest volume of traffic accidents. As we can assume,
				those two days are the days when most people have plans for their entertainment, usually involving
				alcohol consumption. Thus, those days have the most risk of fatal accidents, as supported already by
				other studies <a href="credits.html#source_7">[7]</a>.</li>
			<li>Finally, the most careless ages are found to be between 18-30. As we can assume, during those ages a lot of people go out more often, due to having less responsibilities and often due to the immaturity of the drivers and lack of experience. This is also supported by studies that support this conclusion <a href="credits.html#source_8">[8]</a>.</li>
